## Skyrmion-Diode-Simulation

All simulations were conducted in [MUMAX3](https://mumax.github.io/), using GoogleColab. It is required to use a NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA. 
# File Name Structure
All the folder follows the format of " $x$ nm LR", where $x$ is the skyrmion size, and LR/RL stands for the skyrmion travel direction. LR: Left to Right; RL: Right to Left.
